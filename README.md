## Overview

The **Advanced File Encryption Tool** is a robust, user-friendly application designed for encrypting and decrypting files securely using AES-256 encryption. In addition to its strong encryption capabilities, the tool also supports file compression and decompression, making it a versatile solution for managing sensitive data. Whether for personal or professional use, this tool helps ensure your files are protected while also being optimized for storage.

Built for professionals in the **Cyber Security** and **Ethical Hacking** domains, this tool provides a combination of AES encryption, secure key management, and a graphical interface for easy file operations.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Secure your files with the industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithm.
- **AES Modes**: Supports AES modes like CBC and CTR for different use cases.
- **Passphrase-Based Key Derivation**: Uses the Scrypt key derivation function to securely generate encryption keys from passphrases.
- **File Compression**: Compress files into `.zip` format before encrypting to save space.
- **File Decompression**: Decompress `.zip` files after decryption for easier access to the original data.
- **Secure File Deletion**: Overwrites files multiple times to securely delete them after encryption.
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar during encryption, decryption, and compression tasks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A GUI built with **Tkinter** for easy navigation and interaction.

## How to Use

### 1. **Encrypt Files**:
   - Click on the "Encrypt File" button.
   - Select the file you wish to encrypt.
   - Enter a passphrase for key generation.
   - Choose your AES encryption mode (CBC or CTR).
   - Optionally, enable file compression before encryption.
   - The encrypted file will be saved with the `.enc` extension.

### 2. **Decrypt Files**:
   - Click the "Decrypt File" button.
   - Select the encrypted `.enc` file.
   - Enter the passphrase you used for encryption.
   - The decrypted file will be saved without the `.enc` extension.

### 3. **Compress Files**:
   - Before encryption, check the "Compress before encrypting" option to compress files into a `.zip` format.

### 4. **Decompress Files**:
   - Click on the "Decompress File (Zip)" button to decompress `.zip` files that were previously compressed during encryption.
